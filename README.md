## Abstract

Victoria Land, located within the Transantarctic Mountains, 
features a significant rift basin that is critical for 
understanding Earth's tectonic history. This study aims to 
investigate the tectonic structure and geophysical framework of 
the region through advanced gravity and magnetic modeling using 
data from NASAâ€™s Operation IceBridge. By analyzing airborne datasets 
alongside geological constraints, we will delineate subsurface structures, 
identify key tectonic phases, and explore the relationship between tectonic 
dynamics and geological evolution. Our findings will contribute to 
reconstructing Victoria Land's geological timeline and enhance our understanding 
of potential natural resources in the area. Additionally, this research will 
examine how tectonic variations may influence ice dynamics and their implications 
for climate change. Ultimately, this work seeks to advance knowledge of Antarctic 
tectonics and inform broader discussions on polar regions.
